# fn_scintilla

Java 8 functional interfaces for consumption by Java 7 and Android programs. By adding this dependency one can use the Functional interfaces present in Java 8 (sans package name), which are also similiar to Google's Guava interfaces.  If at some point in the rosy future you're able to use the native Java 8 interfaces, simply remove this dependency and replace the fn_scintilla package name with the standard Java package.

## Interfaces Provided

Consumer, Supplier, Function, Predicate
